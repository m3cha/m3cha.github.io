<p>Ryan Jones is a web developer and information technology professional, currently residing in Fairfax Virginia. Before moving to Virginia, he received a bachelor's degree in computer science from Troy University where he worked for four years as an IT technician.  He also gained experience as a web developer during an internship program at the Charles Koch Institute.<br/>
Outside of work, Ryan likes to spend time on smaller projects, including the development of websites and indie games. He is passionate about economics, free market capitalism, bitcoins and alternative currency, liberty, freedom of speech, and game design. He has recently developed an affinity for entering competitive gaming development contests (game jams), and he still occasionally loses himself in role-playing games.</p>
